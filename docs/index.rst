Welcome to Sensor-fusion Demo's documentation!
==============================================

This application demonstrates the capabilities of various sensors and sensor-fusions. Data from the Gyroscope, Accelerometer and compass are combined in different ways and the result is shown as a cube that can be rotated by rotating the device.

The major novelty in this application is the fusion of virtual sensors: **Improved Orientation Sensor 1** and **Improved Orientation Sensor 2** fuse the Android Rotation Vector with the virtual Gyroscope sensor to achieve a pose estimation with a previously unknown stability and precision.

Apart from these two sensors, the following sensors are available for comparison:

- Improved Orientation Sensor 1 (Sensor fusion of Android Rotation Vector and Calibrated Gyroscope - less stable but more accurate)
- Improved Orientation Sensor 2 (Sensor fusion of Android Rotation Vector and Calibrated Gyroscope - more stable but less accurate)
- Android Rotation Vector (Kalman filter fusion of Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Compass)
- Calibrated Gyroscope (Separate result of Kalman filter fusion of Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Compass)
- Gravity + Compass
- Accelerometer + Compass

This application was developed for demonstrating the sensor fusion approach developed for my `Master Thesis "Sensor fusion for robust outdoor Augmented Reality tracking on mobile devices <https://alexanderpacha.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/masterthesis-pacha.pdf>`_ at the `Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand <http://www.hitlabnz.org>`_.


Euler Angles
============

Euler-Angles are also often referred to as Azimuth, Pitch and Roll and describe the rotation of an object in the three-dimensional space with respect to three axis that are simple to understand and visualize. However, they have certain limitations and have therefore been removed from this project.

If you want to obtain the rotation using Euler-Angles, check out `the last tag that contained the Euler angles <https://bitbucket.org/apacha/sensor-fusion-demo/commits/tag/BeforePerformanceImprovements>`_. Notice that they have been removed, because many people don't understand Euler Angles fully and are surprised, when they get results, that they did not expect (because the representation is ambiguous and suffers from Gimbal Lock). Try to use a Rotation Matrix, a Rotation Vector or Quaternions instead.

This `Wikipedia entry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles>`_ shows how to convert Quaternions into Euler angles.

A short summary can also be found in this `Stackoverflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/a/18800083/448357>`_.


Installation
============

This project is an Gradle-based Android Studio project. It is also published in the `Google Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hitlabnz.sensor_fusion_demo>`_, if you just want to try it out.
