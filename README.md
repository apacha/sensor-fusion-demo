# Sensor fusion demo for Android

[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/46b5cf7adea1286f/status.svg?token=MZUhPFZvIBiaTSEinY9zUQ&branch=main)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/46b5cf7adea1286f)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sensor-fusion-demo/badge/?version=latest)](http://sensor-fusion-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This application demonstrates the capabilities of various sensors and sensor-fusions. Data from the Gyroscope, Accelerometer and compass are combined in different ways and the result is shown as a cube that can be rotated by rotating the device.

Read the full documentation [here](http://sensor-fusion-demo.readthedocs.io).

The major novelty in this application is the fusion of virtual sensors: **Improved Orientation Sensor 1** and **Improved Orientation Sensor 2** fuse the Android Rotation Vector with the virtual Gyroscope sensor to achieve a pose estimation with a previously unknown stability and precision.

Apart from these two sensors, the following sensors are available for comparison:

- Improved Orientation Sensor 1 (Sensor fusion of Android Rotation Vector and Calibrated Gyroscope - less stable but more accurate)
- Improved Orientation Sensor 2 (Sensor fusion of Android Rotation Vector and Calibrated Gyroscope - more stable but less accurate)
- Android Rotation Vector (Kalman filter fusion of Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Compass)
- Calibrated Gyroscope (Separate result of Kalman filter fusion of Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Compass)
- Gravity + Compass
- Accelerometer + Compass

This application was developed for demonstrating the sensor fusion approach developed for my [Master Thesis "Sensor fusion for robust outdoor Augmented Reality tracking on mobile devices"](https://alexanderpacha.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/masterthesis-pacha.pdf) at the [Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand](http://www.hitlabnz.org).
